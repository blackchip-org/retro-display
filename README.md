# retro-display

I had this great idea of a game where the user interface was an old-school
terminal. I wrote this code but I had no clue how the end-game would work. 
Mid-game was a problem too. Early-game needed improvment. 
Ideas never materialized. 

Don't let good code go to waste. I made some javascript consoles using 
the old-school displays.
